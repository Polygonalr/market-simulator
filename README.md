## Market Simulator in C++

Both client and server code included. As of now, this repo is mainly skeleton code that uses `boost::asio` to deal with networking between server and clients, with no actual logic (yet...?). I mainly wrote this to practice writing code with `boost::asio`.

Documentation is purposely mostly left out, for reasons that I shall not disclose.
